  <p><strong><a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/">A Gibberlings Three Mod</a><br />
    Authors: Andyr, 'Cam' Camagna, NiGHTMARE</strong></p>
  <p><strong> Version 7 - <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/downloads/#cleric">Check
    for the most recent version</a></strong></p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>The Divine Remix aims to rebalance and change several aspects of divine-magic-using
    classes (clerics, paladins, druids, and rangers) in Baldur's Gate (via <a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/tutu/">Baldur's
    Gate Tutu</a>) and Baldur's Gate II. The mod originally began as Cleric Remix.</p>
  <p>This originally started as a project to simply add some cleric kits to Baldur's
    Gate II. Andyr and NiGHTMARE, already planning something similar (though
    far more extensive) for their upcoming Lands of Intrigue mod, came on board
    and helped us with the concept, implementation, and scope of the mod. The
    mod has several goals, aimed at enhancing role-playing for these four classes.
    First was an overall expansion of kits and options available for each class--there
    are many, many Faer&ucirc;nian deities available, and while we won't be able
    to address all of them (including several of the more common deities or,
    more specifically, their specialty priests), the mod will give the players
    new ways to explore the stories and adventures of both <acronym title="Baldur's Gate">BG</acronym> and <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>.
    To truly accomplish differentiation, however, we had to really revamp the
    divine magic system. Most notably, we've adapted the <acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym> system
    of spell spheres (more on this below) to better reflect the diversity of
    beliefs among deities and their followers. New spells have also been added. </p>
  <p><strong>Spells and spheres </strong></p>
  <p>The most notable change to the spell system is the proper implementation
    of spheres. Like arcane magic and its school system, divine magic can be
    broken into spheres such as animal, necromancy, protection, etc. The spells
    available to a divine caster are limited to spheres related to their deity's
    portfolio. There are three levels of sphere access: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Major - character can cast all spells in this sphere </li>
    <li> Minor - character can cast spells up to and including level three in
      this sphere </li>
    <li> None - character can not cast spells in this sphere </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The different spell selections available to a character can vary, sometimes
    significantly, between classes and even within kits of a class. The spells
    available to the character reflect their beliefs, and as such, one spellbook
    for all no longer makes sense. Sphere restrictions are now included in kit
    descriptions. Under the implementation of spheres, spells that had previously
    been druid-only are now accessible to some specialty priests and in some
    cases (Dolorous Decay) available to trueclass clerics as well. New divine
    spells are included. If a spell belongs to multiple spheres, access to any
    of the spell's spheres will grant a character access to the spell. Access
    to all spheres is not required. </p>
  <p>Alignment now also plays a larger role in spell selection as the selection
    of spells considered 'good' and 'evil' has been expanded. The added wrinkle
    is that deity alignment now plays a role: if a spell is considered an 'evil'
    spell, your neutral deity may not grant it to you even if your character
    is evil. The biggest change on this front is that
    the harmful versions of necromantic spells (i.e. Cause Wounds, Slay Living,
    Harm, etc.) are now considered 'evil' spells, as they're treated in
    <acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym>.  (Note that  Oghma and Kossuth are the two exceptions--as they welcome
    followers of all alignments, they do not restrict granting spells based on
    their evil or good connotations, though your character's alignment will still
    apply. </p>
  <p><strong>General cleric changes </strong></p>
  <p>Clerics were the starting point of the mod, and as such are the most changed
    of the four classes. A full sphere system has been implemented for the three
    existing kits as well as the new kit priests. Trueclass clerics receive an
    additional spell per level to compensate for their smaller spell selections
    in spell levels four to seven, whereas kits gain innate abilities relevant
    to their deity. Kits also have unique holy symbols for their deities, for <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym> players.
    Trueclass clerics have major access to the spheres of all, charm, combat,
    creation, divination, guardian, healing, necromantic, protection, and summoning
    and minor access to the spheres of elemental (earth) and elemental (water). </p>
  <p><strong>General druid changes</strong></p>
  <p>In this version, only minor changes are made to druids. Druids have looser
    bounds on their neutrality requirements--rather than being restricted to
    True Neutral, druids are now allowed to have any alignment that contains
    neutrality: neutral good, neutral evil, lawful neutral, and chaotic neutral
    are now allowed in addition to true neutral. Druids (and their kits, mod
    or otherwise) have been moved to a druid-appropriate spell sphere selection
    of major access to all, animal, elemental (all), healing, plant, sun and
    weather.</p>
  <p><strong>General paladin changes</strong></p>
  <p>Paladins (and their kits, mod or otherwise) have been moved to a paladin-appropriate
    spell sphere selection of major access to the spheres of combat, divination,
    healing and protection.</p>
  <p><strong>General ranger changes</strong></p>
  <p>Rangers (and their kits, mod or otherwise) have been moved to a ranger-appropriate
    spell sphere selection of major access to all, animal, healing, plant, and
    weather.</p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod is designed to work with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>:
    Shadows of Amn with or without the expansion pack Throne of Bhaal. With Throne
    of Bhaal, High Level Abilities (<acronym title="High Level Abilities">HLAs</acronym>)
    are also restricted by sphere and some kits have unique <acronym title="High Level Abilities">HLAs</acronym> pertaining
    to their deity. The mod is also designed to be compatible with <a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/tutu/">Baldur's
    Gate Tutu</a>. Because of the extensive changes to the divine spellcasting
    classes there are some compatibility issues of which to be aware. </p>
  <p><strong>Divine kit mods</strong></p>
  <p> Divine kits will have their spellbooks adjusted for the base class spell
    spheres provided by Divine Remix, provided this mod is installed after them.
    If kits are installed after Divine Remix, those kits will have no divine
    spells available for casting, unless they're designed to work with <acronym title="Divine Remix">DR</acronym> (the
    kits in Oversight as of v8 and SP Collection as of v7 can be installed after <acronym title="Divine Remix">DR</acronym>,
    for example). Because of hardcoded engine limitations, no more than nine
    kits for any class are available for selection by the player at any time.
    The Feralan and Justifier kits included in Unfinished Business are identical
    to the two offered in Divine Remix. If the kits from <acronym title="Unfinshed Business">UB</acronym> are
    installed prior to <acronym title="Divine Remix">DR</acronym>, they will
    be adjusted to use the proper sphere restrictions and the versions from Divine
    Remix will not install.</p>
  <p>There is now a <a href="http://forums.gibberlings3.net/index.php?showtopic=7639&amp;hl=">how-to
      available</a> for modders who wish to either remove install-order issues
      with <acronym title="Divine Remix">DR</acronym> or use the sphere system
      for their kits. </p>
  <p><strong>Tweak mods </strong></p>
  <p>The mod is fully compatible with the changes made in the <a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/aoe/">Ashes
      of Embers</a> Universal Weapons component, provided Divine Remix is installed
      after it. Divine Remix is compatible with all components of <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Tweaks.
      The mod will not conflict with the changes made in Kish's Oversight mod,
      though some of the changes introduced there are implemented in Divine Remix
      and some are overwritten. For example, Divine Remix also fixes the bug
      that prevents Cleric-Rangers from obtaining the Cleric Stronghold, but
      it does not allow monks to obtain them. Other tweak mods are, to the best
      of our knowledge, fully compatible. </p>
  <p><strong>Spell packs and high level ability mods </strong></p>
  <p>This mod will conflict with cleric and druid <acronym title="High Level Ability">HLA</acronym> tables
    from Refinements, as Divine Remix uses its own tables. In general new divine
    spells, unless specifically designed for Divine Remix compatibility, will
    either be exempt from spell sphere restrictions or will not be available
    for clerics or paladins (depending on install order). Changes to existing
    spells should work fine. </p>

</div>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Core Components<br />
    </strong><em>This is required for all other components</em></p>
  <p>This component will install the base, shared components between the four
    classes, such as the spell sphere system, spell corrections, compatibility
    fixes, and new spells. This component is required for all other components
    in the mod. Installing this component will impose sphere restrictions on
    all divine characters. </p>
  <p>New divine spells include: Alicorn Lance, Beast Claw, Cause Blindness or
    Deafness, Cause Disease, Cause Light Wounds, Cause Medium Wounds, Conjure
    Air Elemental, Cure Blindness or Deafness, Curse, Detect Good, Divine Shell,
    Energy Drain, Faerie Fire, Impervious Sanctity of Mind, Impregnable Mind,
    Moonblade, Protection from Good, Protection from Good 10', Resist Acid and
    Corrosion, Strength of Stone, and Sunscorch.</p>
  <p>Many spells also had incorrect sphere assignments (or none listed). The
    spellbooks of all divine casters will be adjusted to reflect their sphere
    restrictions. </p>
  <p><strong>Disable Mod Kits</strong><br />
    <em>Requires Core Components </em></p>
  <p>When selecting a kit at character creation, the Infinity Engine is hardcoded
    to display only nine choices. You can install more than nine kits, but only
    the first nine installed will be offered as selections. This component gives
    you the option of making all previously installed kits invisible at character
    creation, leaving a blank slate for new kits. Please note that this component
    only removes the kits from selection at character creation--any creatures
    that still need to use these kits (such as enemies or <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>)
    will be fine, i.e. removing the Lathander kit will not prevent the Lathander
    priests at the temple from being Morninglords.</p>
  <p> For each class, you have the option of removing mod kits, or mod and original
    Bioware kits. At present, this option is available for all but the paladin
    class, as it's the only one in the current release without new kits available. </p>
  <h4 class="subheader">Cleric Remix </h4>
  <p><strong>Cleric Remix <br />
    </strong> <em>Requires Core Components<br />
    Required for all Divine Remix cleric kits </em></p>
  <p>This component will implement proper spell sphere restrictions for clerics
    and for the original three kits included in <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>.
    The cleric maximum spell progression has been altered to match available <acronym title="Second Edition">2e</acronym> source
    material--the most notable difference is that very high level clerics should
    see more 7th level spell slots. </p>
  <p>The clerical strongholds have also been changed slightly, following along
    the lines of Oversight. Cleric-Rangers will now be offered a choice of stronghold,
    and the alignment requirements to assist one of the <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> temples
    have been altered slightly--Helm no longer accepts Chaotic-aligned characters,
    for example. The kitted clerics will be offered a stronghold based on their
    deity, though some trueclass clerics, Painbearers, and Firewalkers will be
    offered a choice between two temples. </p>
  <p>The original three Bioware kits have been changed as follows:</p>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>MORNINGLORD OF LATHANDER: Lathander, also called the Morninglord, is the
      god of the spring, dawn, birth, and renewal, a god of beginning and hidden
      potential, a deity of conception, vitality, youth, renewal, and self-perfection.
      He is the commander of creativity. He is a native of the plane of Elysium,
      and he is on good terms with Chauntea. Lathander's symbol is a simple disk
      of rosy pink hue. These disks are often cut of rose quartz or similar minerals.</p>
    <p>Lathander is a god of beginnings, and even individuals who worship other
      gods still offer a prayer to him at the start of a journey of endeavor.
      Lathander's name is invoked to seal alliances and start new ventures or
      companies. As a result, Lathander is very popular among the merchant classes,
      and has benefited accordingly.</p>

  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>WATCHER OF HELM: The god of guardians and protectors, Helm is the epitome
      of the guardian, the watcher, the guard, and has in years past been greatly
      venerated by those who need to remain watchful for evil at their doorsteps.
      Helm is ever-vigilant, and embodies the spirit of lawful neutrality. Helm
      makes his home on the clockwork plane of Nirvana, in a region separate
      from Mystra. Helm's Symbol is an open eye painted onto a gauntlet.</p>
    <p>Helm teaches that one must be ever vigilant, ever aware, ever prepared
      for one's enemies. He also serves those who stand, wait and watch carefully.
      Careful planning will always defeat rushed actions in the end.</p>

  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>STORMLORD OF TALOS: Talos is the destructive force of nature. He is the
      god of storms, forest fires, earthquakes, tornadoes, and general destruction.
      He makes his home in the aptly named plane of Pandemonium. He attracts
      the destroyer, the raider, the looter, and the brigand among his followers.
      Talos' symbol is three lightning bolts, each a separate color, radiating
      from a central point.</p>
    <p>Talos the Destroyer is the dark side of nature, the uncaring and destructive
      force that lays waiting to strike at any time. Talos is more feared than
      worshipped, which seems to account for his great popularity as much as
      anything. The church of Talos exults in the wild destruction of nature
      at its fiercest, trusting to its own luck and the favor (or ill-favor)
      of the god to protect it. Church members tend to be fatalistic in nature
      as a result--almost self-destructive. However, clerics of Talos wish to
      take as many others with them as possible.</p>
    <p>Stormlords of Talos can only be of Chaotic Evil, Chaotic Neutral, and
      Neutral Evil alignments.</p>
    <p>Abilities:<br />
      - Spiritual Weapon: Half-Spear - 'Fury of Talos' once per day<br />
      The Half-Spear is the spiritual weapon of Stormlords of Talos, and is wielded
      as if the caster had grand mastery in the weapon. The Half-Spear is a regular
      weapon at levels 1-5, +1 at levels 6-10, +2 at 11-15, +3 at 16-20, +4 at
      21-25, and +5 at levels 26 and above. The spiritual weapon lasts for one
      round per level of the caster, up to 20 rounds and can be used once per
      day.<br />
      - Innate electrical resistance of 1% per level<br />
      - Destructive Blow once per day<br />
      Once per day, a Stormlord can focus the destructive wrath of Talos in combat.
      This spell grants the Stormlord +2 to damage and +2 to hit for one round
      per level, up to 20 rounds.<br />
      - From level 7 can cast Storm Shield once per day<br />
      This spell lasts 1 round per level of the caster. It protects the caster
      from lightning, fire, cold and normal missiles<br />
      - From level 9 can cast Cloudkill once per day, as fifth level mage spell
      of the same name<br />
      - From level 11 can cast Chain Lightning once per day, as sixth level mage

  <p><strong>Silverstar of Sel&ucirc;ne</strong><br />
    <em>Requires Cleric Remix component</em></p>
  <p>This component installs the Silverstar of Sel&ucirc;ne cleric kit.</p>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p> SILVERSTAR OF SEL&Ucirc;NE: Sel&ucirc;ne (pronounced: seh-loon-ay), Our
      Lady of Silver, is the goddess of the moon, the stars, and those who use
      them to navigate. Her eternal foe is the evil Shar, goddess of darkness,
      night, loss, and forgetfulness. Sel&ucirc;ne is often called the Moonmaiden
      for her connection to the silver moon that orbits Faer&ucirc;n. She is
      the goddess of the moon and travelers. Sel&ucirc;ne's home plane is The
      Gates of the Moon with her home a shining hall of silver called Argentil.</p>
    <p>Non-evil lycanthropes honor Sel&ucirc;ne as the master of their fate as
      do astrologers and fortune tellers. Sel&ucirc;ne is also growing popular
      among alewives, laundresses, seamstresses and servants with the message
      of female empowerment. She is also worshiped by female spellcasters, navigators
      and sailors.</p>
    <p>Sel&ucirc;ne's clerics, called Silverstars of Sel&ucirc;ne, are dedicated
      advocates of freedom and tolerance, wanderers on the path of truth and
      absolute foes of Shar. They seek to build harmony among lycanthropes and
      non-shapechangers, and they protect the weak and the oppressed everywhere.
      They cannot abide slavery, and they hate most undead. They rarely settle
      in one place for long, instead moving along when seized by wanderlust or
      enticed by a new cause or mission. They deal with lunar energies and phenomena
      and are, to a limited degree, able to wield the power of the moon, bringing
      its fierce, pure white light to Toril to advance the goddess's wishes.</p>
    <p>Silverstars of Sel&ucirc;ne can only be of Chaotic Good, Neutral Good,
      and Chaotic Neutral alignments</p>
    <p>Abilities:<br />
      - Spiritual Weapon: Mace - 'Moon's Hand' once per day<br />
      The Moon's Hand is the spiritual weapon of Silverstars of Sel&ucirc;ne,
      and is wielded as if the caster had grand mastery in the weapon. The Moon's
      Mace is a regular weapon at levels 1-5, +1 at levels 6-10, +2 at 11-15,
      +3 at 16-20, +4 at 21-25, and +5 at levels 26 and above. The spiritual
      weapon lasts for one round per level of the caster, up to 20 rounds.<br />
      - Infravision<br />
      - Can cast Moon Shield once per day<br />
      Upon casting this spell, the Silverstar receives a resistance to all magic.
      The resistance conferred is 2% per level of the cleric up to a maximum
      of 40% at 20th level. This resistance is set so if the target already has
      more magic resistance than the cleric would confer, it will actually lower
      it to the set value. This effect will last for the duration of the spell
      or until dispelled.<br />
      - From level 7 can cast Free Action once per day, as fourth level cleric
      spell of the same name<br />
      - From level 9 can cast Sunfire once per day, as fifth level mage spell
      of the same name<br />
      - From level 11 can cast Summon Air Elemental once per day, as sixth level
      mage spell of the same name<br />
      - From level 14 can cast Protection From The Elements once per day, as
      seventh level mage spell of the same name</p>
    <p>Sphere Access:<br />

  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>NIGHTCLOAK OF SHAR: Shar is the goddess of darkness, night, loss, and
      forgetfulness. Her main aspect is worshipped by those who deal in the night
      (such as thieves), who hate the light (such as goblin races and their allies),
      and who feel bitterness and loss. Her symbol is a black disk with a border
      of deep purple.</p>
    <p>Shar's mortal enemy is the goddess Sel&ucirc;ne and the two fight on a
      number of levels throughout their immortal lives. There is a continual
      war between the two faiths and jihads against Sel&ucirc;ne and her followers
      are common where Shar is strong.</p>
    <p>Clerics of Shar are called Nightcloaks. They exist outside the standard
      church hierarchy. Shar has no main temple, but instead has a scattering
      of cells and secretive places throughout the Realms. The Nightcloaks of
      Shar serve as contacts, messengers, and enforcers of the Dark Lady's will.</p>

  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>HOLY STRATEGIST OF THE RED KNIGHT: Holy Strategist is the name by which a
      cleric of the Red Knight is known, and it is an apt title indeed. By
      devoting themselves to mastering military tactics and strategy, these 
      militant clerics hone their minds and bodies into the deadliest weapons 
      in Faerun. So impressive is their reputation that armies outnumbering 
      their foes three to one have been known to surrender upon learning that
      a Holy Strategist leads the opposing force.</p>
    <p>Collectively, the clerics of the Red Knight are referred to as the Red
      Fellowship. Many members serve as high-ranking commanders in armies
      throughout Faerun, often personally leading elite "special forces" units.
      Others who are not directly in the employ of the church serve as
      instructors at military academies or as quartermasters in charge of keeping
      the troops on the front line fed and supplied. When they are not in battle,
      Holy Strategists wear flowing robes of red accented with white.</p>

      the next. Such is the nature of war as embodied by Tempus.</p>
    <p>The dress of the priest of Tempus is armor, battle-worn and battered.
      In more civilized regions this has been replaced by a steel skullcap, but
      the message is the same--these are warrior priests. Their place is in the
      trenches with the troops, urging them onwards. Priests of Tempus may be

    <p>PAINBEARER OF ILMATER: Ilmater is the Crying God, the god of endurance,
      suffering, martyrdom, and perseverance. It is he who offers succor and
      calming words to those who are in pain, oppressed, or in great need. He
      is the willing sufferer, the one who takes the place of another to heft
      the other's burden, to take the other's pain. He is the god of the oppressed
      and unjustly treated. In early days Ilmater's symbol was a blood stained
      rack, but of late a set of white hands bound by a blood red cord is used.
      The latter symbol has increased Ilmater's popularity in the world at large.
      Ilmater dwells in the Twin Paradises.</p>
    <p>The followers of Ilmater are often perceived as being intentional sufferers,
      but in reality they offer a great deal along the &quot;pure clerical&quot; nature
      of healing and recovery to those who have been hurt. They put others ahead
      of themselves, are sharing, and emphasize the spiritual nature of life
      over the gross material body. Ilmater's priests are found where they are
      needed, which is usually in the worst possible conditions, ministering
      to the needs of the oppressed, and the poor. They dress simply in gray,
      with gray skullcaps (blood red for the higher ranks).</p>

  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>FIREWALKER OF KOSSUTH: Kossuth, Firelord, the Tyrant among Fire, is an
      Elemental Lord from the Elemental Plane of Fire. He is generally uncaring
      to his faithful, but continues to grant his priests their powers since
      their worship increases his power on his home plane. To maintain continued
      worship he does take a limited interest in his followers' mortal problems,
      and occasionally makes his presence known with a manifestation, but never
      an avatar.</p>
    <p>Kossuth's church is varied and chaotic since he takes no interest in its
      structure. As a result it is a collection of cults with each faction coming
      up with its own ethics, codes, morals, and teachings. Kossuth's symbol
      varies greatly from faction to faction, but is generally a depiction of
      fire. It is believed that if Kossuth's following were to somehow become
      unified he would become a very powerful force in the Realms, something
      the other gods don't really wish to see happen. Of the four Elemental Lords,
      the best known and most feared are the cults of Kossuth, who are very powerful
      in Thay and the lands of the East.</p>
    <p>Firewalkers of Kossuth can be of any alignment, but most are evil, reveling
      in the destructive power of fire. They can be members of any race. They
      dress in whatever their faction deems appropriate for the representation
      of their god. This is usually robes and long capes in reds, yellows, and
      oranges.</p>

  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>AUTHLIM OF IYACHTU XVIM: Iyachtu Xvim is said to the result of a union
      between the Black Lord, Bane, and a greater or a true tanar'ri, and thus
      the blood of Bane runs through his veins. Another tale says he is the spawn
      of the Black Lord and a corrupted Paladin. Also called the Godson and the
      Son of Bane, Xvim has served as Bane's instrument in the Realms, carrying
      out the will of his father. He appears either as a gaunt, naked man with
      a great scimitar or a black cloud with glowing green eyes.</p>
    <p>Xvim was imprisoned under Zhentil Keep during the Time of Troubles, where
      he was held for ten years. He managed to free himself when Zhentil Keep
      fell during the Cyrinishad fiasco, where he also managed to steal the portfolios
      of Tyranny and Hatred away from Cyric. He is now the god of Fear, Hatred,
      Malice, and Tyranny. He is working toward fully taking the place of his
      father, Bane, which makes him a bitter enemy of Cyric. His following is
      strongest in the East, particularly in Thay, but his priesthood is rapidly
      spreading throughout the Realms. His priests favor black robes trimmed
      with dark green. They also wear black iron gauntlets with glowing green
      eyes painted on the back of the hand. These gauntlets are actually the
      priests' holy symbols of Xvim.</p>

      god of knowledge in the Realms (second if you consider magical ability
      as knowledge, with Mystra at its head). Deneir and Milil both act as intercessors
      for Oghma, carrying new information both to him and to those whom Oghma
      favors.</p>
    <p>Oghma's followers believe that knowledge is most supreme, particularly
      in its raw form, the idea. An idea has no weight but can move mountains.
      It has no height but it can dominate a nation. It has no mass but it can
      push aside empires. Knowledge is the greatest tool of humankind, outweighing

    <p>HEARTWARDER OF SUNE: Sune (pronounced: sue-nee) Firehair is said to be
      the fairest of all the powers. When she is represented, she is shown as
      the most beautiful woman in the Realms, with sweeping, radiant, red hair
      and incredible charms. The Sunite faith is a popular one in large metropolitan
      areas and among the nobility. Those of a literary or artistic bent, as
      well as people falling in love or looking for lifemates, often venerate
      the Lady Firehair.</p>
    <p>Sune herself is said to be benevolent and sometimes whimsical, alternating
      between deep passions and shallow flirtations. She has been romantically
      linked with many of the Faer&ucirc;nian powers in the myths of the Realms,
      though she has never shown any love at all for the gods of fury, Talona,
      or Tempus, since their functions posit the destruction of many beautiful
      things, both living and inanimate. Currently, she is rumored to have been
      rather smitten by the noble actions of Torm at Tantras during the Time

    <p>Sune's specialty priests, known as Heartwarders of Sune, are aesthetes
      and hedonists who actively seek out pleasure and beauty in all things,
      and who nurture the creation of beautiful objects. They are typically found
      in large cities in the company of the cultural elite. Most are active patrons
      of the arts, and all play the role of matchmaker for persons in all levels
      of society. Many are employed as artists, crafters, performers, or instructors,

      Corellon shed in epic battles with Gruumsh mingled with Sehanine's (or
      Angharradh's) tears. The Creator of the Elves embodies the highest ideals
      of elvenkind, and he is the patron of most aesthetic endeavors, including
      art, magic, music, poetry, and warfare. He is venerated by all the Fair
      Folk, except the drow and those who have turned to Lolth, Ghaunadaur, Vhaeraun,
      and other dark powers. Corellon is especially popular with elf and half-elf
      mages, musicians, and poets.</p>
    <p>Ceremonial vestments for priests of Corellon consist of azure robes made
      of gossamer and embroidered with silver quarter moons. Silver circlets
      engraved with the Protector's symbol are worn on the brow. The holy symbol
      of the faith is a silver or mithral lunate pendant worn on a slender chain
      hung from the neck. When adventuring, Corellon's priests generally favor
      traditionally elven equipment in conscious imitation of their divine patron.</p>
    <p>Feywardens of Corellon must be elves or half-elves, and may be of chaotic
      good, neutral good or chaotic neutral alignment.</p>
    <p>Abilities:<br />
      - Spiritual Weapon: Longsword - 'Sahandrian' once per day<br />
      Sahandrian is the spiritual weapon of Feywardens of Corellon, and is wielded

      weapon at levels 1-5, +1 at levels 6-10, +2 at 11-15, +3 at 16-20, +4 at

  <p><strong>Strifeleader of Cyric</strong><br />
    <em>Requires Cleric Remix component</em></p>
  <p>This component installs the Strifeleader of Cyric cleric kit.</p>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <div class="kit_description">
      <p>STRIFELEADER OF CYRIC: Cyric (seer-ick) is a megalomaniacal deity with
        an immense following. One of the three greater powers of evil on Faer&ucirc;n,
        he is petty and self-centered, and enjoys misleading individuals of all
        inclinations so that they perform acts that ruin their lives or so that
        they make fatal mistakes. He drinks the tears of disillusioned dreamers
        and broken-hearted lovers. He is not above an alliance with another deity
        as long as he thinks he can betray the other divine power and come out
        ahead.</p>
      <p>Cyric's church is pledged to spread strife and work murder everywhere
        in order to make folk believe in and fear the Dark Sun. It supports cruel
        rulers and indulges in intrigue in such a way that the world won't be
        overrun by wars (and thus fall under the sway of Tempus). His church
        is often beset by internal feuds and backstabbing, but this conflict
        has decreased in recent years as Cyric has gained better control of himself
        and has consolidated the churches of the deities whose portfolios he
        took over.</p>
      <p>Strifeleaders wear black and purple robes. Silver bands, the symbol
        of their enslavement to Cyric, are worn on their wrists. Strifeleaders
        of Cyric may be of Chaotic Neutral or any Evil alignment.</p>
      <p>Abilities:<br />
        - Spiritual Weapon: Long Sword - 'Razor's Edge' once per day<br />
        Razor's Edge is the spiritual weapon of Strifeleaders of Cyric, and is
        wielded as if the caster had grand mastery in the weapon. The Razor's
        Edge is a regular weapon at levels 1-5, +1 at levels 6-10, +2 at 11-15,
        +3 at 16-20, +4 at 21-25, and +5 at levels 26 and above. The spiritual
        weapon lasts for one round per level of the caster, up to 20 rounds.<br />
        - May coat his weapon in poison once per day per 6 levels. Attacks made
        in the next round with that weapon will inject the poison into the target,
        dealing out 1 damage per second for 24 seconds (3 damage for the first
        6 seconds). A saving throw vs. poison limits damage to 12 total.<br />
        - From level 7 can cast Dread Blast once per day<br />
        Fires a ray of negative energy that deals 4d8 damage +1/level (max +20)
        and confuses target for 1 round (save vs. spell at -2 to negate confusion)<br />
        - From level 9 can cast Chaos once per day, as fifth level mage spell
        of the same name<br />
        - From level 11 can cast Death Fog once per day, as sixth level mage
        spell of the same name<br />

  <h4 class="subheader">Druid Remix </h4>
  <p><strong>Druid Remix <br />
    </strong> <em>Requires Core Components<br />
    Required for all Divine Remix druid kits </em></p>
  <p>This component loosens the alignment restrictions for druids. Druids can
    now be any alignment as long as one component of their alignment is neutral.
    New allowed alignments are neutral good, lawful neutral, true neutral, chaotic
    neutral, and neural evil. This component also enforces stronger restrictions
    on fighter-druids--previously, fighter-druids could use armor unavailable
    to regular druids. This loophole has been closed. </p>
  <p><strong>Oozemaster </strong><br />
    <em>Requires Druid Remix component</em></p>
  <p>This component installs the Oozemaster druid kit.</p>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>OOZEMASTER DRUID: Seeping out of every crack and crevice in the dungeon
      is some foul, monochromatic substance that adventurers wish wasn't there.
      Just when they get around the yellow mold, green slime drips from the ceiling.
      Quite often, such abominations well up naturally, but occasionally they
      are placed by a more deliberate hand--that of the oozemaster.</p>
    <p>The oozemaster is not a class for stable individuals. It involves relating
      one-on-one with things that relate to nothing at all. Unlike the kindred
      creatures of most druids, the oozemaster's charges have nothing to say.
      No one has yet developed a Speak with Ooze spell--or if someone has, the
      oozes haven't responded. Given that oozemasters exude everything but confidence,
      most of them have few sentient friends and even fewer guests. Thus, they
      tend to gibber and talk to themselves a lot.</p>
    <p>There are, however, substantial rewards to pursuing the path of the oozemaster.
      As their powers develop they find themselves taking on many of the characteristics
      of their favored creatures, although they become increasingly alien of
      mindset and find it harder to relate to others. By this point, though,
      they tend not to see this as much of a disadvantage.</p>
    <p>Advantages:<br />
      - May use a Paralytic Touch attack once per day per 5 levels.<br />
      This spell functions in the same manner to the second level mage spell
      Ghoul Touch<br />
      - From level 5, the oozemaster's alien metabolism makes them immune to
      poison<br />
      - From level 7, may shapeshift to the form of a mustard jelly. This ability
      is useable 3 times per day<br />
      - From level 9, oozemasters become immune to acid<br />
      - From level 11, the oozemaster's alien metabolism renders them immune
      to disease<br />
      - From level 15, oozemasters become immune to blindness, sleep, paralysis,
      stunning and critical hits as they become one with the ooze and lack a
      discernable internal anatomy</p>
    <p>Disadvantages:<br />
      - No access to spells from the spheres of animal or plant<br />
      - Do not gain other standard druidic special abilities (such as shapeshifting
      into wolves or bears, or the elemental resistance gained at high levels)<br />
      - Suffers a -1 penalty to Charisma at levels 1, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 15 as they
      become increasingly separated from a humanoid mindset and their features
      continue to distort </p>

  <p><strong>Bowslinger</strong><br />
    <em>Requires Core Components</em></p>
  <p>This component installs the Bowslinger ranger kit.</p>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>BOWSLINGER: The Bowslinger is the epitome of elven skill with the bow.
      If there is a difficult shot to make, he will make it. Whether the target
      can only be reached by firing through high winds or is totally concealed,
      the Bow Slinger is confident of his ability to make the shot.</p>
    <p>Bowslingers must be elves or half-elves.</p>
    <p>Advantages:<br />
      - +1 <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class Zero">THAC0</acronym> and damage
      with any missile weapon for every three levels of experience, slowing to
      every five levels once the bowslinger reaches 18th level<br />
      - Can achieve high mastery with any ranged weapon<br />
      - May use the 'Called Shot' ability once a day per four levels (starting
      at 4th level). When the bowslinger activates this ability, any shot made
      within the next 20 seconds gains +1 to both <acronym title="To-Hit Armor Class Zero">THAC0</acronym> and
      damage for every four levels of experience<br />
      - May use the 'Speed Shot' ability once a day per eight levels (starting
      at 8th level). When the bowslinger activates this ability, he makes one
      extra attack per round for five rounds<br />
      - May cast 'Detect Invisibility' once a day per six levels (starting at
      6th level)</p>
    <p>Disadvantages:<br />

    Divine Remix this component will not install but the kit will work in the
    game fine. </p>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>FERALAN: What happens to children who wander in the wilderness and are
      never recovered? Or worse, those who are abandoned there? Many succumb
      to the dangers of the wild, but a fortunate few are taken in by animals,
      raised as a part of a lion's brood, or a wolf's litter. Cut off from civilization,
      they gradually take on the characteristics of the creatures who adopted
      them, forming some kind of unity with the spirit of the wild. In the process
      they become feralans, beings who combine the savagery of beasts with the
      intellect of man.</p>
    <p>Feralans cannot be Lawful Good.</p>
    <p>Advantages:<br />
      - +10% to stealth<br />
      - +1 to Armor Class for every 5 levels of experience (starting at 1st level)<br />
      - May use the 'Feral Rage' ability once a day per 10 levels. The enraged
      state lasts for 60 seconds, and grants a bonus of +2 to hit, damage, and <acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym>,
      and immunity to charm, hold and fear, maze, imprisonment, stun and sleep.
      He also gains 15 temporary hit points<br />
      - May use the 'Call of the Wild' ability once a day. This unique ability
      summons an animal companion who will fight for the caster for 3 rounds
      + 1 round/level. More powerful creatures are summoned at higher levels.</p>
    <p>Disadvantages:<br />
      - Becomes winded after Feral Rage. While he's winded he receives -2 to
        hit, -2 to damage and a +2 penalty to armor class<br />
      - Can only be proficient with bastard swords, long swords, short swords,
      two-handed swords, katanas, scimitars, halberds, flails and crossbows<br />
      - Cannot wear any armor or use large shields<br />

  <p><strong>Forest Runner </strong><br />
    <em>Requires Core Components</em></p>
  <p>This component installs the Forest Runner ranger kit.</p>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>FOREST RUNNER: Wherever a corrupt or oppressive regime holds power, there's
      bound to be a Forest Runner. Forest Runners rise in opposition to such
      regimes, living on the fringes of society, usually one step ahead of the
      law. They're criminals only in a technical sense, as they adhere to a personal
      code that compels them to wage war against greedy aristocrats and unjust
      rulers. While the powers-that-be view the Forest Runner as a lawless troublemaker,
      commoners see him as hero, perhaps their best hope against a tyrannical
      government.</p>
    <p>Forest Runners cannot be Lawful Good.</p>
    <p>Advantages:<br />
      - +5% to stealth<br />
      - Can achieve mastery with long bows, quarterstaffs, long swords, and daggers<br />
      - May use the 'Inspire' ability once a day per six levels (starting at
      1st level). This unique ability boosts the morale and attack rolls of the
      Forest Runner's companions for 3 rounds.</p>
    <p>Disadvantages:<br />
      - May not wear any metallic armor<br />
      - Can only be proficient with axes, two-handed swords, warhammers, and

    game fine. </p>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>JUSTIFIER: Some expeditions are so demanding and some foes so dangerous
      that they require the attention of a highly trained specialist whose combat
      skills far exceed those of the typical ranger. Enter the Justifier, a master
      tactician whose military instincts, fighting versatility, and steely nerves
      places him in the first rank of elite warriors.</p>
    <p>For a determined Justifier no job is too difficult, no enemy too formidable.
      Their proficiency with weapons gives them an edge in combat, though the
      smaller time devoted to magical training leaves them slightly lacking in
      that department.</p>
    <p>Justifiers must be Lawful Good.</p>
    <p>Advantages:<br />
      - +10% to stealth<br />
      - +1 to hit and +1 to speed factor for every 10 levels of experience</p>
    <p>Disadvantages:<br />
      - Does not gain 'Charm Animal' as an innate ability<br />

    <em>Requires Core Components</em></p>
  <p>This component installs the Wilderness Runner ranger kit.</p>
  <div class="kit_description">
    <p>WILDERNESS RUNNER: There are rangers, and then there are rangers. Elves
      are uniquely connected with the rhythms of the forests, some more deeply
      than others. Only those who have chosen to become rangers may elect to
      become more fully part of the forest, casting aside the trappings of even
      elven society to serve the needs of the wood. They are called wilderness
      runners.</p>
    <p>Only elves may be Wilderness Runners.</p>
    <p>Advantages:<br />
      - +10% resistance to non-magical fire and cold<br />
      - Can achieve mastery with long bows and quarterstaffs<br />
      - May use the 'Enhanced Charm Animal' ability once a day per two levels
