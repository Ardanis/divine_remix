@102 =~Alicorn Lance~
@103 =~Alicorn Lance (Invocation)
Level: 2
Sphere: Animal
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell creates a silver-hued, partially ethereal lance shaped in the form of an alicorn (a unicorn horn).  The spellcaster chooses a target and the alicorn lance instantaneously fires at it, inflicting 2d8 points of piercing damage, with a saving throw for half damage.  Although the alicorn lance dissipates after it strikes, it leaves a silvery radiance around the target that makes it easier to see and hit, giving it a -2 penalty to the target's armor class for 3 rounds.~
@104 =~Curse~
@105 =~Curse (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 1
Sphere: All
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 6 rounds 
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 25-foot radius
Saving Throw: None

When the Curse spell is uttered, the caster lowers the morale of enemy creatures and penalizes their saving throws and attack rolls by -1. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 50-foot cube centered on the point selected by the caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effect; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not).~
@106 =~Sunscorch~
@107 =~Sunscorch (Invocation)
Level: 1
Sphere: Sun
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: 1/2

When this spell is cast, a brilliant ray of scorching heat slants down from the sky and strikes one target of the caster's choice.  The victim is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to take half damage.  Any creature struck by the ray sustains 1d6 points of damage, plus 1 point per caster level.  Undead creatures and monsters vulnerable to bright light sustain 1d6 points of damage, plus 2 points per level of the caster.  In addition to sustaining damage, victims are also blinded for 3 rounds by the spell.~
@108 =~Beast Claw~
@109 =~Beast Claw (Alteration)
Level: 2
Sphere: Combat, Necromantic
Range: Caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell transforms the caster's arms into the claws of a mighty beast, giving the caster 18/72 strength and the ability to rake an opponent for 2d4 (+ strength bonus) points of slashing damage.  The caster can attack twice per round with the beast claws, with a +2 bonus to hit.~
@110 =~Moonblade~
@111 =~Moonblade (Invocation)
Level: 3
Sphere: Combat, Sun
Range: Caster
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell summons forth a silent, weightless sword-like construct made of moonlight that extends 4 feet from the caster's hand.  The moonblade is considered a +4 weapon for determining what creatures it can damage, though the bonus does not apply to THAC0.  In addition, due to the insubstantial nature of the moonblade, melee bonuses from strength do not apply. The strike of a moonblade drains a target's vitality, inflicting 1d12+4 points of damage, and an additional 1d12 points to undead, who are particularly susceptible.  A successful strike also temporarily scrambles magic, causing any spells the target casts in the next round to fail.~
@112 =~Faerie Fire~
@113 =~Faerie Fire (Evocation)
Level: 1
Sphere: Weather
Range: Sight of Caster
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/5 levels
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 Creature
Saving Throw: None

Faerie Fire outlines the target creature with a pale glow, making its position and movements easily visible. The net effect is an armor class penalty of -2 to the target.~
@114 =~Command (Enchantment/Charm) 
Level: 1
Sphere: Charm, Combat, Law 
Range: 30 yards 
Duration: 1 round 
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Special

This spell enables the cleric to command another creature to "die" (sleep) for a single round.  At the end of the round, the creature awakens and is unharmed.  Creatures with 6 or more hit dice (or experience levels) are entitled to a saving throw vs. spells to ignore the command.~
@115 =~Draw Upon Holy Might (Invocation) 
Level: 2
Sphere: Summoning
Range: 0 
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 

The cleric calls upon his god to grant him power for a short period.  When he does this, his strength, constitution and dexterity all are raised by 1 point for every 3 levels of the caster.  A third level caster would have his abilities raised by 1, while a 12th level caster would have all his abilities raised by 4.~
@116 =~Summon Insects
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Sphere: Animal
Range: 30 yds.
Duration: 7 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

The summon insects spell attracts a cloud or swarm of normal insects to attack one enemy of the caster.  This swarm gathers at a point chosen by the caster, within the spell's range, and attacks any single creature the caster points to.
The victim may make a saving throw vs. breath weapons (with a -4 penalty) to escape the swarm.  Otherwise, the victim receives 1 point of damage every two seconds for the duration of the spell. The victim fights with a -2 penalty to his attack roll and a +2 penalty to his Armor Class. The swarm will repeatedly bite the target, making it very difficult to cast spells (50% spell failure).~
@117 =~Confusion (Enchantment/Charm) 
Level: 7
Sphere:  Charm
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/ 2 levels
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Up to 60-foot cube 
Saving Throw: Special 

This spell causes confusion in one or more creatures within the area, creating indecision and the inability to take effective action. All creatures within the area of effect are allowed saving throws vs. spell with - 2 penalties.  Those successfully saving are unaffected by the spell. 

The spell lasts for one round for every two levels of the caster.  Those who fail their saving throws will go berserk, stand confused or wander about for the duration of the spell.
Wandering creatures move as far from the caster as possible, according to their most typical mode of movement (characters walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.).  Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to its basic nature.~
@118 =~Regeneration (Necromancy) 
Level: 7
Sphere:  Necromancy
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 round/ 2 levels
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Target Creature
Saving Throw: None 

This powerful spell enables the cleric to imbue 1 creature with the ability to regenerate.  This regeneration will heal any wounds and even regenerate lost limbs.  The creature affected will regain 3 hit points per second.  The effect lasts for 1 round per every 2 levels of the caster or until dispelled.  For example, a 14th level cleric would regenerate 18 hit points per round for 7 rounds.~
@119 =~Detect Evil (Divination) 
Level: 1
Sphere:  Divination
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Sight
Saving Throw: None 

This spell discovers emanations of evil from any creature. Any evil creature within the range of the spell will glow red briefly.~
@120 =~Poison (Necromancy) 
Level: 4
Sphere:  Healing
Range: 15 feet
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Negates

Through this spell, the caster can poison victims who fail their save vs. poison.  The effects depend upon the caster's level and are detailed below:
7-9th level:  2d8  +  2/round
10-12th level:  3d8  + 3/round
13-14th level:  4d8  +  4/round
15-16th level:  6d8  +  5/round
17+ level:  8d8  +  6/round
Those who make their saving throws are unaffected.~
@121 =~Doom (Alteration) 
Level: 1
Sphere: Charm
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: 1 turn 
Casting Time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None 

This spell causes a feeling of doom to overwhelm the target.  For the duration of the spell, the target receives a -2 penalty to all his rolls, this includes THAC0 and saving throws.  There is no saving throw for this spell. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.~
@122 =~Sanctuary (Abjuration) 
Level: 1
Sphere: Charm, Protection 
Range: 0 
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 4 
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None 

When the cleric casts a sanctuary spell, it causes all of his opponents to ignore his existence; as if he is invisible.  While protected by this spell, the subject cannot take direct offensive action without breaking the spell, but may use non-attack spells or otherwise act in any way that does not violate the prohibition against offensive action. This allows a warded cleric to heal wounds, for example, or to bless himself.  He cannot cast spells on other creatures without ending the spell.~
@123 =~Aid (Necromancy, Conjuration)
Level: 2
Sphere: Combat, Necromantic 
Range: Touch 
Duration: 1 round + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None

The recipient of this spell gains the benefit of a bless spell (+ 1 to attack rolls and saving throws) and a special bonus of 1d8 additional hit points for the duration of the spell. The aid spell enables the recipient to actually have more hit points than his full normal total. The bonus hit points are lost first when the recipient takes damage; they cannot be regained by curative magic. Example: A 1st-level fighter has 8 hit points, suffers 2 points of damage (8 - 2 = 6), and then receives an aid spell that gives 5 additional hit points. The fighter now has 11 hit points, 3 of which are temporary. If he is then hit for 7 points of damage, 4 normal hit points and all 3 temporary hit points are lost. He then receives a cure light wounds spell that heals 4 points of damage, restoring him to his original 8 hit points.~
@124 =~Hold Person (Enchantment/Charm) 
Level: 2
Sphere: Charm, Law 
Range: Visual range of caster 
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: Target, and anyone within 5 feet
Saving Throw: Neg. 

This spell holds one or more humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immobile and in place for one turn.  This includes: brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be held, while an ogre could not. 
The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster.  Every enemy within 5 feet of the target is also affected.  Those who succeed on their saving throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held. 
Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them even though they are helpless to change them. 
Time passes at a normal rate for the targets and hence being held does not stop any worsening of their condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~
@125 = ~Cure Disease (Abjuration)
Level: 3
Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

By laying her hands upon a sickly person, the caster can cure almost any disease with this spell.  The cure is permanent, but this does not grant the recipient of the spell immunity from further afflictions.  Feeblemind is also cured with this spell.  Some magically created diseases may not be curable by this spell.~
@126 =~Dispel Magic (Abjuration)
Level: 3
Sphere: All
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 6 
Area of Effect: 30-foot cube 
Saving Throw: Special

A dispel magic removes magical effects upon anyone within the area.  This includes effects given from spells, potions and certain magical items such as wands.  It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Turning, and Spell Deflection.  The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%.  For every level that the caster of the dispel magic is above the original caster, his chance of success increases by 5%.  For every level that the caster of dispel magic is below the original caster, his chance of success decreases by 10%.  However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic he is trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure.  Similarly if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic he is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success.  Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the target is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.
Note:  while this spell dispels the individual effects of grease, web, stinking cloud and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect.~
@127 =~Holy Smite (Necromancy)
Level: 3
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Caster line of sight
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3 
Area of Effect: 20 foot radius
Saving Throw: Special 

This spell calls upon energy from the plane of brilliance in order to open a channel between it and the targets.  The result is that any evil creatures within the spell effect take 1-4 damage for every level of the caster with a save vs. spell for half.  Also, if the victim fails his save, then he is blinded for 1 round.~
@128 =~Invisibility Purge (Divination) 
Level: 3
Sphere: Wards
Range: Visual range of caster 
Duration: Instant 
Casting Time: 8 
Area of Effect: 30 foot radius
Saving Throw: None 

Any invisible creatures within the area of effect have their invisibility dispelled.  This includes creatures that are in sanctuary, improved invisibility, and shadow door.~
@129 =~Protection From Fire (Abjuration) 
Level: 3
Sphere: Elemental (Fire) 
Range: Touch 
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6 
Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 

The effects of a protection from fire spell last no longer than three rounds plus one round per caster level.  When the spell is cast, it confers complete invulnerability to normal fires (torches, bonfires, oil fires, and the like).  Likewise this spell absorbs 80% of all damage done by magical fires such as fiery dragon breath, spells such as burning hands, fireball, fire seeds, fire storm, flame strike, meteor swarm, hell hound or pyrohydra breath, etc. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.~
@130 =~Remove Curse (Abjuration) 
Level: 3
Sphere: All
Range: Touch 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 6 
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special 

Upon casting this spell, the cleric is usually able to remove a curse on an object, on a person, or in the form of some undesired sending or evil presence. Note that the remove curse spell does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, for example, although the spell typically enables the person afflicted with any such cursed item to get rid of it. Certain special curses may not be countered by this spell, or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or more.~
@131 =~Remove Paralysis (Abjuration) 
Level: 3
Sphere: Necromantic, Protection 
Range: 10 yards/level 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 6 
Area of Effect: 20 ft radius
Saving Throw: None 

By the use of this spell, the cleric can free several creatures from the effects of any paralyzation or related magic (such as a ghoul touch, or a hold spell).~
@132 =~Unholy Blight (Necromancy) 
Level: 3
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Caster line of sight
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3 
Area of Effect: 20 foot radius
Saving Throw: Special 

This spell calls upon energy from the negative material plane in order to open a channel between it and the targets.  The result is that any good creatures within the spell effect take 1-4 damage for every level of the caster with a save vs. spell for half.  Also, if the victim fails his save, then he receives a -2 penalty to all his rolls for 4 rounds.~
@133 =~Zone of Sweet Air (Abjuration) 
Sphere: Elemental (air), Wards
Range: 30 yards
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Zone of Sweet Air repels all noxious elements from poisonous vapors (including magically created vapors such as Cloudkill).  This spell will dismiss all clouds in the entire area that the caster is currently in.  The spell offers no protection against poisonous vapors created by a dragon's breath weapon (such as the chlorine gas of a green dragon).~
@134 =~Animal Summoning I 
(Conjuration, Summoning) 
Level: 4
Sphere: Animal
Range: 20 yards
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 7 
Area of Effect: Special

@136 =~Farsight (Divination)
Level: 4
Sphere: Divination
Range: Special
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4 
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 

When Farsight is cast, the caster is able to view an area of an unexplored map.  After casting the spell, simply click on a section of the map that you want to view.  For the duration of the spell, the caster can spy on that area, noting creatures and fortifications.~
@137 =~Holy Power (Evocation) 
Level: 4
Sphere: Combat
Range: None
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

Through this spell, the caster imbues himself with the strength and skill of a fighter of the same level.  The cleric's strength is set to 18/00, even if it is normally higher, his THAC0 becomes that of a fighter of the same level, and he gains 1 temporary hit point for every level he has attained.  This will last for the duration of the spell or until successfully dispelled. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.~
@138 =~Protection From Evil 10' Radius
(Abjuration) 
Level: 3
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch 
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 10' radius
Saving Throw: None 

When this spell is cast, all creatures within a 10' radius are affected individually by 'protection from evil'.  It creates a magical barrier around the recipients at a distance of one foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has two major effects: First, all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures against the protected creature receive a penalty of - 2 to each attack roll, and second, any saving throws caused by such attacks are made by the protected creature with a +2 bonus.~
@139 =~Protection From Lightning (Abjuration) 
Level: 4
Sphere: Weather
Range: Touch 
Duration: 5 rounds/level
Casting Time: 7 
Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 

When the spell is cast, it confers complete invulnerability to electrical attack such as magical attacks (lightning bolt, shocking grasp etc..)  The protection will last for the duration of the spell or until successfully dispelled.~
@140 =~Animal Summoning II 
(Conjuration/Summoning) 
Level: 5
Sphere: Animal 
Range: 60 yards/level 
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 8 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

By means of this spell, the caster calls from one to three animals that have 8 Hit Dice or less.  The animals summoned aid the caster by whatever means they possess, staying until the spell duration expires. Only normal or giant animals can be summoned; fantastic animals or monsters cannot be summoned by this spell (no chimerae, dragons, gorgons, manticores, etc.).~
@141 =~Greater Command (Enchantment/Charm) 
Level: 5
Sphere: Charm, Combat, Law
Range: Visual range of caster 
Duration: 1 round/level of caster
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 20 ' radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

As with the first level spell 'Command', this spell enables the cleric to command other creatures to "die" (sleep), except that the effects of this spell last for one round per caster level.  At the end of the round the creature(s) awaken and are unharmed.  The area of effect is similar to that of a stinking cloud or a fireball.~
@142 =~Insect Plague 
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Sphere: Animal
Level: 5
Range: 120 yds.
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Enemies within visual range
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast by the cleric, a horde of creeping, hopping, and flying insects gather and swarm.  This swarm will jump first to the target, then to the nearest allies of the target, until six creatures have been affected.  Spellcasting within the swarm is impossible (100% failure rate). Creatures in the insect plague, regardless of Armor Class, sustain 1 point of damage for every two seconds they remain within, due to the bites and stings of the insects. Invisibility is no protection.  Due to the suffocating nature of the writhing insect swarm, each victim must make a saving vs. breath weapon or run away in fear for a round.~
@143 =~Iron Skins (Alteration) 
Sphere: Elemental (earth)
Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: 12 hours
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None 

When a druid casts this powerful spell upon herself, an outer skin of iron will move up from the ground completely covering her.  This skin is, of course, magical and will hinder the druid in no way.  The effect of this is to protect the druid from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles.  For every two levels of the caster, an additional skin is gained upon casting.  For example, a 10th level druid would receive 5 skins.  For each skin the druid possesses, the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th level druid would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against her but the sixth would affect her normally.  The skins will remain on the druid until she is affected by a dispel magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks or the spell duration expires.  It is important to note that this will not protect the druid from any area attacks such as fireball, however it will protect her from physical magical attacks such as magic missile.~
@144 =~Pixie Dust
(Illusion/Phantasm) 
Sphere: Combat
Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: None 

This spell creates a small handful of pixie dust that the caster can use to toss into the air.  Anyone hit by the dust becomes invisible (the range of the dust is about 30').  Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature or his gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so.  Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible, items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the wizard or recipient cancels it, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. Thus the invisible being can walk around and cast defensive spells.  However, if he attacks, he immediately becomes visible, although the invisibility enables him to attack first.~
@145 =~Repulse Undead
(Abjuration)
Sphere: Necromantic
Level: 5
Range: Caster 
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This powerful spell creates waves of anti-negative plane energy that sweep outwards from the caster.  This wave disrupts any undead that attempt to attack the caster, pushing them away from the caster for several seconds.  There is one wave each round for the duration of the spell.  All undead are affected, without a saving throw.~
@146 =~Slay Living (Necromancy) 
Level: 5
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Touch 
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Special

Upon casting this spell, the cleric has to touch an opponent in order to visit the effect upon them.  An item is created upon casting, the next attack made is with this item and the cleric will then have 18 seconds in order to make this attack.  If the first attack misses, then the item disappears and the spell is wasted, however if the attack succeeds then the victim automatically takes 2d6 + 9 damage.  Also, he must make a save vs. spell or be instantly killed.  The spell can be dispelled if cast between the casting of this spell and the necessary attack.~
@147 =~True Seeing (Divination) 
Level: 5
Sphere: All
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 70' radius
Saving Throw: None 

When this spell is cast, an area roughly 70 feet in radius around the caster will be affected.  Instantly and once each round for 1 turn after this spell is cast, all hostile illusion/phantasm spells in the area of effect will be dispelled.  The spells that are affected by this are: Reflected Image, Invisibility, Mirror Image, Non-detection, Improved Invisibility, Shadow Door, Mislead, Project Image, and Simulacrum.  The area of effect is roughly a 70' radius around the caster.  The target's magic resistance, if any, does not come into effect with this spell.  This spell only affects enemies, thus it is unable to dispel the invisibility from a party member.~
@148 =~Animal Summoning III
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 6
Sphere: Animal
Range: 60 yards 
Duration: 4 turns
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special

@10171 =~STORMLORD OF TALOS: Talos is the destructive force of nature. He is the god of storms, forest fires, earthquakes, tornadoes, and general destruction. He makes his home in the aptly named plane of Pandemonium. He attracts the destroyer, the raider, the looter, and the brigand among his followers. Talos' symbol is three lightning bolts, each a separate color, radiating from a central point.

Talos the Destroyer is the dark side of nature, the uncaring and destructive force that lays waiting to strike at any time. Talos is more feared than worshipped, which seems to account for his great popularity as much as anything. The church of Talos exults in the wild destruction of nature at its fiercest, trusting to its own luck and the favor (or ill-favor) of the god to protect it. Church members tend to be fatalistic in nature as a result--almost self-destructive. However, clerics of Talos wish to take as many others with them as possible.

Stormlords of Talos can only be of Chaotic Evil, Chaotic Neutral, and Neutral Evil alignments.

@10302 =~SILVERSTAR OF SELUNE: Selune (pronounced: seh-loon-ay), Our Lady of Silver, is the goddess of the moon, the stars, and those who use them to navigate. Her eternal foe is the evil Shar, goddess of darkness, night, loss, and forgetfulness. Selune is often called the Moonmaiden for her connection to the silver moon that orbits Faerun. She is the goddess of the moon and travelers. Selune's home plane is The Gates of the Moon with her home a shining hall of silver called Argentil.

Non-evil lycanthropes honor Selune as the master of their fate as do astrologers and fortune tellers. Selune is also growing popular among alewives, laundresses, seamstresses and servants with the message of female empowerment. She is also worshiped by female spellcasters, navigators and sailors.

Selune's clerics, called Silverstars of Selune, are dedicated advocates of freedom and tolerance, wanderers on the path of truth and absolute foes of Shar. They seek to build harmony among lycanthropes and non-shapechangers, and they protect the weak and the oppressed everywhere. They cannot abide slavery, and they hate most undead. They rarely settle in one place for long, instead moving along when seized by wanderlust or enticed by a new cause or mission. They deal with lunar energies and phenomena and are, to a limited degree, able to wield the power of the moon, bringing its fierce, pure white light to Toril to advance the goddess's wishes.

Her symbol is a black disk with a border of deep purple.

Shar's mortal enemy is the goddess Selune and the two fight on a number of levels throughout their immortal lives. There is a continual war between the two faiths and jihads against Selune and her followers are common where Shar is strong.

Clerics of Shar are called Nightcloaks. They exist outside the standard church hierarchy. Shar has no main temple, but instead has a scattering of cells and secretive places throughout the Realms. The Nightcloaks of Shar serve as contacts, messengers, and enforcers of the Dark Lady's will.

A powerful spell granted by Shar to the most worthy of her clerics, Shar's Curse sucks the wits from her foes, leaving them incapable of performing actions--a fitting curse from the Lady of Loss.

By devoting themselves to mastering military tactics and strategy, these militant clerics hone their minds and bodies into the deadliest weapons in Faerun. So impressive is their reputation that armies outnumbering their foes three to one have been known to surrender upon learning that a Holy Strategist leads the opposing force.

Collectively, the clerics of the Red Knight are referred to as the Red Fellowship. Many members serve as high-ranking commanders in armies throughout Faerun, often personally leading elite "special forces" units. Others who are not directly in the employ of the church serve as instructors at military academies or as quartermasters in charge of keeping the troops on the front line fed and supplied. When they are not in battle, Holy Strategists wear flowing robes of red accented with white.

Holy Strategists of the Red Knight can only be of Lawful Good, Lawful Neutral, and Lawful Evil alignments.

The dress of the priest of Tempus is armor, battle-worn and battered. In more civilized regions this has been replaced by a steel skullcap, but the message is the same--these are warrior priests. Their place is in the trenches with the troops, urging them onwards. Priests of Tempus may be found on both sides of a conflict, as none can ever truly know who the war god will favor.

@11202 =~PAINBEARER OF ILMATER: Ilmater is the Crying God, the god of endurance, suffering, martyrdom, and perseverance. It is he who offers succor and calming words to those who are in pain, oppressed, or in great need. He is the willing sufferer, the one who takes the place of another to heft the other's burden, to take the other's pain. He is the god of the oppressed and unjustly treated. In early days Ilmater's symbol was a blood stained rack, but of late a set of white hands bound by a blood red cord is used. The latter symbol has increased Ilmater's popularity in the world at large. Ilmater dwells in the Twin Paradises.

The followers of Ilmater are often perceived as being intentional sufferers, but in reality they offer a great deal along the "pure clerical" nature of healing and recovery to those who have been hurt. They put others ahead of themselves, are sharing, and emphasize the spiritual nature of life over the gross material body. Ilmater's priests are found where they are needed, which is usually in the worst possible conditions, ministering to the needs of the oppressed, and the poor. They dress simply in gray, with gray skullcaps (blood red for the higher ranks).

Painbearers of Ilmater can only be of Lawful Good, Neutral Good, and Lawful Neutral alignments.

@11503 =~Firewalker of Kossuth~
@11504 =~FIREWALKER OF KOSSUTH: Kossuth, Firelord, the Tyrant among Fire, is an Elemental Lord from the Elemental Plane of Fire. He is generally uncaring to his faithful, but continues to grant his priests their powers since their worship increases his power on his home plane. To maintain continued worship he does take a limited interest in his followers' mortal problems, and occasionally makes his presence known with a manifestation, but never an avatar.

Kossuth's church is varied and chaotic since he takes no interest in its structure. As a result it is a collection of cults with each faction coming up with its own ethics, codes, morals, and teachings. Kossuth's symbol varies greatly from faction to faction, but is generally a depiction of fire. It is believed that if Kossuth's following were to somehow become unified he would become a very powerful force in the Realms, something the other gods don't really wish to see happen. Of the four Elemental Lords, the best known and most feared are the cults of Kossuth, who are very powerful in Thay and the lands of the East.

Firewalkers of Kossuth can be of any alignment, but most are evil, reveling in the destructive power of fire. They can be members of any race. They dress in whatever their faction deems appropriate for the representation of their god. This is usually robes and long capes in reds, yellows, and oranges.

Abilities:

Level: Quest
Sphere: Elemental, fire
Range: Caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect:  Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

Calling upon his deity's blazing touch, the Firewalker channels some of Kossuth's searing energy through himself. Both sides of fire's majestic power - both it's destructiveness, and it's ability to purify - are in evidence. Firstly, this spell deals 15d6 fire damage (save vs. spells for half) to all foes within 30 feet of the caster. This does not affect party members. Secondly, the caster's body is purified by the holy flames, as per the effects of a Heal spell.

Choosing this allows the casting of the spell once per day as an innate ability. It can only be chosen once.~

@11802 =~AUTHLIM OF IYACHTU XVIM: Iyachtu Xvim is said to the result of a union between the Black Lord, Bane, and a greater or a true tanar'ri, and thus the blood of Bane runs through his veins. Another tale says he is the spawn of the Black Lord and a corrupted Paladin. Also called the Godson and the Son of Bane, Xvim has served as Bane's instrument in the Realms, carrying out the will of his father. He appears either as a gaunt, naked man with a great scimitar or a black cloud with glowing green eyes.

Xvim was imprisoned under Zhentil Keep during the Time of Troubles, where he was held for ten years. He managed to free himself when Zhentil Keep fell during the Cyrinishad fiasco, where he also managed to steal the portfolios of Tyranny and Hatred away from Cyric. He is now the god of Fear, Hatred, Malice, and Tyranny. He is working toward fully taking the place of his father, Bane, which makes him a bitter enemy of Cyric. His following is strongest in the East, particularly in Thay, but his priesthood is rapidly spreading throughout the Realms. His priests favor black robes trimmed with dark green. They also wear black iron gauntlets with glowing green eyes painted on the back of the hand. These gauntlets are actually the priests' holy symbols of Xvim.

Deneir and Milil both act as intercessors for Oghma, carrying new information both to him and to those whom Oghma favors.

Oghma's followers believe that knowledge is most supreme, particularly in its raw form, the idea. An idea has no weight but can move mountains. It has no height but it can dominate a nation.

@12402 =~HEARTWARDER OF SUNE: Sune (pronounced: sue-nee) Firehair is said to be the fairest of all the powers. When she is represented, she is shown as the most beautiful woman in the Realms, with sweeping, radiant, red hair and incredible charms. The Sunite faith is a popular one in large metropolitan areas and among the nobility. Those of a literary or artistic bent, as well as people falling in love or looking for lifemates, often venerate the Lady Firehair.

Sune herself is said to be benevolent and sometimes whimsical, alternating between deep passions and shallow flirtations. She has been romantically linked with many of the Faerunian powers in the myths of the Realms, though she has never shown any love at all for the gods of fury, Talona, or Tempus, since their functions posit the destruction of many beautiful things, both living and inanimate. Currently, she is rumored to have been rather smitten by the noble actions of Torm at Tantras during the Time of Troubles.

Sune's speciality priests, known as Heartwarders of Sune, are aesthetes and hedonists who actively seek out pleasure and beauty in all things, and who nurture the creation of beautiful objects.  They are typically found in large cities in the company of the cultural elite.  Most are active patrons of the arts, and all play the role of matchmaker for persons in all levels of society.  Many are employed as artists, crafters, performers, or instructors, though a few travel the world to promote beauty and love.

Heartwarders of Sune can only be of Neutral Good, Chaotic Good, and Chaotic Neutral alignments.

Elven lore states that the Fair Folk sprang from drops of blood Corellon shed in epic battles with Gruumsh mingled with Sehanine's (or Angharradh's) tears. The Creator of the Elves embodies the highest ideals of elvenkind, and he is the patron of most aesthetic endeavors, including art, magic, music, poetry, and warfare. He is venerated by all the Fair Folk, except the drow and those who have turned to Lolth, Ghaunadaur, Vhaeraun, and other dark powers. Corellon is especially popular with elf and half-elf mages, musicians, and poets.

Ceremonial vestments for priests of Corellon consist of azure robes made of gossamer and embroidered with silver quarter moons. Silver circlets engraved with the Protector's symbol are worn on the brow. The holy symbol of the faith is a silver or mithral lunate pendant worn on a slender chain hung from the neck. When adventuring, Corellon's priests generally favor traditionally elven equipment in conscious imitation of their divine patron.

@13004 =~STRIFELEADER OF CYRIC: Cyric (seer-ick) is a megalomaniacal deity with an immense following. One of the three greater powers of evil on Faerun, he is petty and self-centered, and enjoys misleading individuals of all inclinations so that they perform acts that ruin their lives or so that they make fatal mistakes. He drinks the tears of disillusioned dreamers and broken-hearted lovers. He is not above an alliance with another deity as long as he thinks he can betray the other divine power and come out ahead.

Cyric's church is pledged to spread strife and work murder everywhere in order to make folk believe in and fear the Dark Sun. It supports cruel rulers and indulges in intrigue in such a way that the world won't be overrun by wars (and thus fall under the sway of Tempus). His church is often beset by internal feuds and backstabbing, but this conflict has decreased in recent years as Cyric has gained better control of himself and has consolidated the churches of the deities whose portfolios he took over.

Strifeleaders wear black and purple robes. Silver bands, the symbol of their enslavement to Cyric, are worn on their wrists. Strifeleaders of Cyric may be of Chaotic Neutral or any Evil alignment.

@20303 =~Oozemaster~
@20304 =~OOZEMASTER DRUID: Seeping out of every crack and crevice in the dungeon is some foul, monochromatic substance that adventurers wish wasn't there. Just when they get around the yellow mold, green slime drips from the ceiling. Quite often, such abominations well up naturally, but occasionally they are placed by a more deliberate hand--that of the oozemaster.

The oozemaster is not a class for stable individuals. It involves relating one-on-one with things that relate to nothing at all. Unlike the kindred creatures of most druids, the oozemaster's charges have nothing to say. No one has yet developed a Speak with Ooze spell--or if someone has, the oozes haven't responded. Given that oozemasters exude everything but confidence, most of them have few sentient friends and even fewer guests. Thus, they tend to gibber and talk to themselves a lot.

There are, however, substantial rewards to pursuing the path of the oozemaster. As their powers develop they find themselves taking on many of the characteristics of their favored creatures, although they become increasingly alien of mindset and find it harder to relate to others. By this point, though, they tend not to see this as much of a disadvantage.

Advantages:
-  May use a Paralytic Touch attack once per day per 5 levels.
This spell functions in the same manner to the second level mage spell Ghoul Touch
-  From level 5, the oozemaster's alien metabolism makes them immune to poison
-  From level 7, may shapeshift to the form of a mustard jelly. This ability is useable 3 times per day
-  From level 9, oozemasters become immune to acid
-  From level 11, the oozemaster's alien metabolism renders them immune to disease
-  From level 15, oozemasters become immune to blindness, sleep, paralysis, stunning and critical hits as they become one with the ooze and lack a discernable internal anatomy

Disadvantages:
-  No access to spells from the spheres of animal or plant
-  Do not gain other standard druidic special abilities (such as shapeshifting into wolves or bears, or the elemental resistance gained at high levels)
-  Suffers a -1 penalty to Charisma at levels 1, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 15 as they become increasingly separated from a humanoid mindset and their features continue to distort~

@40303 = ~BOWSLINGER: The Bowslinger is the epitome of elven skill with the bow.  If there is a difficult shot to make, he will make it.  Whether the target can only be reached by firing through high winds or is totally concealed, the Bow Slinger is confident of his ability to make the shot.

Advantages:
-  +1 THAC0 and damage with any missile weapon for every three levels of experience, slowing to every five levels once the bowslinger reaches 18th level
-  Can achieve high mastery (four points) in bows
-  May use the 'Called Shot' ability once a day per four levels (starting at 4th level).  When the bowslinger activates this ability, any shot made within the next 20 seconds gains +1 to both THAC0 and damage for every four levels of experience
-  May use the 'Speed Shot' ability once a day per eight levels (starting at 8th level).  When the bowslinger activates this ability, he makes one extra attack per round for five rounds
-  May cast 'Detect Invisibility' once a day per six levels (starting at 6th level)

Disadvantages:
-  Does not gain 'Charm Animal' as an innate ability
-  -1 to damage with any melee weapon
-  Can only become proficient (one point) in long swords, short swords and daggers
-  Can not even be proficient in any other melee weapon
-  Cannot wear any metal armor~

@40601 = ~feralan~
@40602 = ~Feralan~
@40603 = ~FERALAN: What happens to children who wander in the wilderness and are never recovered? Or worse, those who are abandoned there? Many succumb to the dangers of the wild, but a fortunate few are taken in by animals, raised as a part of a lion`s brood, or a wolf`s litter. Cut off from civilization, they gradually take on the characteristics of the creatures who adopted them, forming some kind of unity with the spirit of the wild. In the process they become feralans, beings who combine the savagery of beasts with the intellect of man.

Feralans cannot be Lawful Good.

Advantages:
-  +10% to stealth
-  +1 to Armor Class for every 5 levels of experience (starting at 1st level)
-  May use the 'Feral Rage' ability once a day per 10 levels.  The enraged state lasts for 60 seconds, and grants a bonus of +2 to hit, damage, and AC, and immunity to charm, hold and fear, maze, imprisonment, stun and sleep.  He also gains 15 temporary hit points
-  May use the 'Call of the Wild' ability once a day.  This unique ability summons an animal companion who will fight for the caster for 3 rounds + 1 round/level.  More powerful creatures are summoned at higher levels.

Disadvantages:
-  Becomes winded after Feral Rage. While he's winded he receives -2 to hit, -2 to damage and a +2 penalty to armor class
-  Can only become proficient (one point) in bastard swords, long swords, short swords, two-handed swords, katanas, scimitars, halberds, flails and crossbows
-  Cannot wear any armor or use large shields
-  Maximum Charisma is 2 points lower than a standard member of the race~

@40902 = ~Forest Runner~
@40903 = ~FOREST RUNNER: Wherever a corrupt or oppressive regime holds power, there's bound to be a Forest Runner. Forest Runners rise in opposition to such regimes, living on the fringes of society, usually one step ahead of the law. They're criminals only in a technical sense, as they adhere to a personal code that compels them to wage war against greedy aristocrats and unjust rulers. While the powers-that-be view the Forest Runner as a lawless troublemaker, commoners see him as hero, perhaps their best hope against a tyrannical government.

Forest Runners cannot be Lawful Good.

Advantages:
-  +5% to stealth
-  Can achieve mastery (three points) with long bows, quarterstaffs, long swords, and daggers
-  May use the 'Inspire' ability once a day per six levels (starting at 1st level).  This unique ability boosts the morale and attack rolls of the Forest Runner's companions for 3 rounds.

Disadvantages:
-  May not wear any metallic armor
-  Can only become proficient (one point) in axes, two-handed swords, warhammers, and crossbows~

@41203 = ~JUSTIFIER: Some expeditions are so demanding and some foes so dangerous that they require the attention of a highly trained specialist whose combat skills far exceed those of the typical ranger. Enter the Justifier, a master tactician whose military instincts, fighting versatility, and steely nerves places him in the first rank of elite warriors.

For a determined Justifier no job is too difficult, no enemy too formidable. Their proficiency with weapons gives them an edge in combat, though the smaller time devoted to magical training leaves them slightly lacking in that department.

Justifiers must be Lawful Good.

Advantages:
-  +10% to stealth
-  +1 to hit and +1 to speed factor for every 10 levels of experience

Disadvantages:
-  Does not gain 'Charm Animal' as an innate ability
-  Spell casting ability limited to:
'Cure Light Wounds' and 'Armour of Faith' once each per day from level 8
'Luck' and 'Remove Fear' once each per day from level 10
'Draw Upon Holy Might' once per day from level 12~

@41502 = ~Wilderness Runner~
@41503 = ~WILDERNESS RUNNER: There are rangers, and then there are rangers.  Elves are uniquely connected with the rhythms of the forests, some more deeply than others.  Only those who have chosen to become rangers may elect to become more fully part of the forest, casting aside the trappings of even elven society to serve the needs of the wood.  They are called wilderness runners.

Advantages:
-  +10% resistance to non-magical fire and cold
-  Can achieve mastery (three points) in long bows and quarterstaffs
-  May use the 'Enhanced Charm Animal' ability once a day per two levels (starting at 1st level). This unique ability replaces 'Charm Animal', lasting twice as long and affecting all animals in the vicinity
-  Can set snares (starts at 20% and improves by 5% per level)

Disadvantages:
-  May not wear any armor greater that studded leather
-  Can only become proficient (one point) in flails, morningstars and warhammers
-  Maximum Charisma is 2 points lower than a standard member of the race~
