@1 =~You are a Firewalker of Kossuth, are you not? It is not often one such as you walks the path of light.~
@2 =~Nonetheless, in this endeavour our goals are aligned. I ask your assistance in exchange for the favor of the temple.~
@3 =~Unleash your powers, Firewalker, as our vassal! You must deliver retribution in the name of the Stormlord!~
@4 =~The paths of the Firewalkers are varied, though you seem to be a servant of order. I ask a boon of you, in exchange for the friendship of the temple.~
